# Restaurant-and-Baker
The "My Restaurant" and "Bakery" project is an immersive, user-friendly website designed to showcase a wide variety of culinary offerings. This dual-concept site serves as an online presence for both a fine dining restaurant and a cozy bakery, providing potential customers with an overview of menu items, specialties, and ambiance.
Through well-organized sections, each establishment presents its unique products—ranging from gourmet meals and specialty drinks in the restaurant section to baked goods, pastries, and beverages in the bakery. The design aims to engage visitors with high-quality images, engaging descriptions, and an intuitive layout that guides them through each menu offering. Furthermore, a clean and modern aesthetic combined with responsive web design ensures that users on both desktop and mobile can easily access the site’s content.
By using HTML for structure, CSS for visual styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, this project creates an inviting digital space that reflects the quality and charm of a real-life dining and bakery experience.
